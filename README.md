sendgrid-cloudfoundry-rails
===========================


A sample application for using Ruby on Rails Framework and [SendGrid](http://www.sendgrid.com) on
[Cloud Foundry](http://www.cloudfoundry.com).

## Running the application on Cloud Foundry

After installing in the 'cf' [command-line interface for Cloud Foundry](http://docs.cloudfoundry.com/docs/using/managing-apps/cf/),
targeting a Cloud Foundry instance, and logging in, the application can be pushed using these commands:

~~~
$ git clone https://github.com/cloudfoundry-samples/sendgrid-cloudfoundry-rails.git
$ cd sendgrid-cloudfoundry-rails
$ cf push
~~~

If prompted to create a service for your app, select `y` and choose the SendGrid service. This will provision an
account on SendGrid and bind it to your app, which stores credentials for the account in the VCAP_SERVICES environment
variable. This application will read those credentials and use them when it sends e-mails.

The application will be pushed using settings in the provided `manifest.yml` file. The settings include some random 
characters in the host to make sure the URL for the app is unique in the Cloud Foundry environment. Once the app is 
uploaded and finishes staging, run the following command to see the URL that was assigned:

~~~
$ cf app
Using manifest file manifest.yml

sendgrid-rails: running
  usage: 512M Ã— 1 instance
  urls: sendgrid-rails-7acab.cfapps.io
  services: sendgrid
~~~

Using the provided URL in the `urls` field displayed, you can browse to the running application. 

You can override the SendGrid credentials in the environment by configuring them in the file
`config/environment.rb`.

## Running the application locally

When running locally, the SendGrid credentials must be set manually in the file
`config/environment.rb`.

After editing the file and adding the credentials, run this command to start the app:

~~~
$rails s
~~~

Once the app is running you can browse to the URL `http://0.0.0.0:3000`.
